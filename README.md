##  âœ¨ AI
Blackbird uses AI-powered NER models to improve metadata extraction, identifying key entities for faster and more accurate insights.
```bash
python blackbird.py --username username1 --ai
```

=======
Can also use a GUI frontend that uses the CLI tool; just install

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and run

Mind the ASCII; it's using the cli as the backend but it will work with most of the functions to be more GUI friendly (or attempt to be).
